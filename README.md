Hello! we are the Loony Squad.

We are a group of FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) students interested in CAD and programming. Our goal is to drive the bleeding edge of innovation in both areas in FTC.
Our members compete in CAD challenges and mentor dozens of teams globally. Our designs are used by many teams and our guidance has inspired countless others.

This page is primarily for sharing our open source CAD, instructions, and programming.

Our current members are:
